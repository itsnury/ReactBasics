# ReactBasics

Using the [Udemy Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/), this repo contains all of the basics that I am learning to create a simple React project.

As a programmer interested in learning more front-end and full-stack development, I will be learning React to improve and expand my knowledge on the subject. This skill will be used for personal and professional development.
